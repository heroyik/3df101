# 👔 New Fashion Design Proposal for the AI Era (Vol. 1)

Welcome to the **"New Fashion Design Proposal for the AI Era (Vol. 1)"** 3D fashion collection. This project showcases a high-fidelity, seasonal wardrobe designed for **Gen-X (male)**, optimized for seamless **WebAR** experiences.

## ✨ Project Highlights
- **Target Persona:** East Asian male (173cm, 65kg) with an athletic swimmer's physique and a clean-shaven, professional look.
- **Design Concept:** A fusion of timeless classic silhouettes and cutting-edge technical performance fabrics, tailored for the Gen-X generation.
- **Platform Compatibility:** Dual-format export ensures a premium experience across Android (GLB) and iOS (USDZ).

## 🚀 Optimized 3D Assets (WebAR Ready)
All models have been decimated by 50% (~11k polygons) and compressed with Draco to ensure ultra-fast loading (<2MB per file) on mobile devices via GitHub Pages.
