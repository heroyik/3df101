# 👔 Tech-Tailoring Reimagined: 2026 Collection (Vol. 1)

Welcome to the **"Modern Tech-Tailoring"** 3D WebAR exhibition. This collection showcases a premium, seasonal wardrobe designed for the AI era, specifically tailored for **Gen-X (173cm / 65kg)**, blending high-end fashion aesthetics with cutting-edge mobile AR technology.

## ✨ 2026 Design Philosophy
The recent redesign transforms the portal from a simple catalog into a high-fashion **Editorial Experience**:
- **Editorial Layout:** A dynamic, asymmetrical grid system inspired by luxury fashion magazines.
- **Minimalist Luxury:** A monochrome palette with gold (`#D4AF37`) accents for a sophisticated, premium feel.
- **Glassmorphism UI:** Interactive cards using modern backdrop-filter effects for depth and elegance.
- **Typography:** Integration of *Playfair Display* (Italy-inspired serif) and *Inter* for maximum visual impact and readability.
- **Scroll Reveal:** Smooth, scroll-triggered animations (fade & slide) for an engaging user journey.

## 🚀 WebAR Ready Assets
All 3D models are precision-engineered for mobile performance:
- **Optimization:** ~11k polygons per model (50% decimation).
- **Compression:** Draco-encoded GLB files for ultra-fast landing (<2MB).
- **Dual Support:** Seamless AR experience on Android (WebXR) and iOS (USDZ Quick Look).
