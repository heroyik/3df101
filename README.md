# 👔 Tech-Tailoring Reimagined: Digital Editorial Edition (2026)

Welcome to the **"Digital Editorial"** renewal of the Tech-Tailoring WebAR exhibition. This version transforms Moda's heritage into a content-first, high-fashion experience inspired by Moda Operandi's philosophy.

## ✨ Renewal Highlights
The collection now features a state-of-the-art **Digital Editorial** interface:
- **Digital Editorial Philosophy:** "Buy directly from the magazine." A seamless blend of high-fidelity 3D assets and storytelling.
- **Asymmetric Grid System:** A dynamic, rhythmic layout that breaks the traditional e-commerce mold, focusing on visual hierarchy and white space.
- **Trunkshow System (Pre-Order):** 
    - **Deposit Logic:** Pay 50% now to reserve 2026 runway pieces.
    - **Countdown UI:** Real-time urgency tracking for exclusive collection closings.
- **Invisible UI:** A minimalist design system (`#000000` / `#FFFFFF`) that disappears, putting all focus on the beauty of the fashion.
- **Size & Fit Guide:** integrated data mapping for luxury brand-to-US/UK size conversion.

## 🚀 Engineering Excellence
- **High-Fidelity Rendering:** Optimized `<model-viewer>` configuration for 런웨이-grade texture and lighting.
- **Skeletal Loading:** Premium-feel skeleton screens for a seamless high-res asset loading experience.
- **Performance:** Native WebP/AVIF support and `loading="lazy"` strategies for high-performance image delivery.
- **Responsive & Accessible:** Fully optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop with AR-ready accessibility.
